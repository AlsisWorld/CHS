    So, you might be wondering why he was drunk at the race? Well, that's because Duncan Hamilton thought that he had been disqualified. So naturally, as the brit he is, he went out to drink that night in order to drown his sorrows away or something.<br><br>
    While he was drinking he was told that he actually wasn't disqualified and had to drive while drunk. This would normally seem like a disaster and that's exactly what everyone else thought too, that's why they tried to make him drink coffee to sober up. His reply to this was asking for brandy. Apperently the alcohol was actually helping him and kept him from getting hungover. He kept this up during the whole race and eventually won while completely plastered.<br><br>
